## About

We all know how tiring it's to send endless CVs each day just for a chance of an interview.

Especially for us migrants it can be even harder with lacking the network, privileges and glass ceilings.

In this workshop we will dissect the job hunting process and brainstorm ideas on how to improve our chances and what we can do collaboratively together as a group actively hunting for a job but tired of doing and thinking it alone.

No registration is require. Only your energy and ideas 🔥

Note: Bring a list of useful websites and links you would like to share in the workshop (ex: board jobs, articles, newsletters, networks, events, ... etc)

We stand in this together ✊
