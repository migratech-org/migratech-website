## About

Our monthly meetup is coming up this Tuesday at C-Base. This time, it's a Knowledge Sharing session 👨‍💻

Ever wanted to showcase your experience and knowledge but never got the chance to share it. Have you applied to tech conferences and always got rejected?

We all had this feeling of being intimated or being just the "diversity token" when it comes to the tech scene in Berlin. That's why some of us in MigraTech are organizing this meetup for knowledge sharing session to showcase your expertise and gain back your confidence 🔥

You will have ~15min to showcase something interesting you know. Remember to bring your laptop 💻
