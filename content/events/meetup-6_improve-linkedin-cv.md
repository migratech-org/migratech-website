## Intro

📝 Workshop: Improving Resume & Linkedin

We know that the current tech job market isn't as easy as it has used to be. That's making it harder to land a job, especially for migrants in Germany.

That's why we are having a collaborative workshop where we all share and work on improving our LinkedIn & CVs to make it easier to bypass the job application phase and get more job interviews as it's a numbers game: the more interviews you get, the higher the chances you will land a job!

No registration is require. Only your energy to improve yourself and also to help other to improve.
We stand in this together ✊

And if you already have a job, you can join and share your privilege to help others 🫂
